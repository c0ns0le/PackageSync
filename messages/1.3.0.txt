=============
Release 1.3.0
=============

File inclusion & exclusion list has been restructured.

By default, files of the following format are included:
- *.sublime-* (with the exclusion of *.sublime-package)
- *.tmLanguage
- *.tmTheme
- *.tmPreferences
- *.json
- *.png
- *.txt
- *.py
- *.md

By default, files of the following format are ignored:
- *.sublime-package (The packages are installed via Package Control
       when restoring the backup.)
- *.DS_Store
- Package Control.last-run
- Package Control.ca-list
- Package Control.ca-bundle
- Package Control.system-ca-bundle

This has been done in order to help users sync their custom packages as well
as to cater to the requirements of other packages.
