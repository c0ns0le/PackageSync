=============
Release 1.3.1
=============

Bug Fixes:
- PackageSync was getting removed upon restoring to fresh machine:
    Fix: PackageSync would always be a part of the sync operation.

- Restore from folder always user default path of user desktop:
    Fix: Now default path is used if prompt is off & path provided
    in settings is false.

- User settings for PackageSync were getting removed upon restore:
    Fix: PackageSync now ensures that the user settings for itself
    are maintained across sync operations.
