=============
Release 1.1.0
=============

The package now supports user defined settings for location to
backup from or restore to.

Also, user now has the ability to provide a separate location 
for each backup/restore operation. For this, the setting "prompt_for_location"
needs to be turned on. Read the documentation for more details.

Also, the ability to ignore specific files/folders & a restriction to the
types of files that can be synced has also been added.
This setting is also user configurable.
