=============
Release 1.3.2
=============

Bug Fixes:
- Package Control.sublime-settings was not being restored:
    Fix: The restore operation for this file would be performed in a delayed
	manner in order to allow installation of missing/new packages.


Feature to Come:
The next release would be published soon. It would allow users to restore from
existing backups without the worry of already present packages getting removed.
This was currently a limitation of PackageSync that had not yet crossed my mind.
